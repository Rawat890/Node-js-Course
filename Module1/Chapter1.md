1.) What is Node js ?
Node js is an open source javascript runtime enviroment that allows us to run javascript in our local environmet indtead of in browser console
Javascript runtime build on the chrome v8 engine that is js running on server in runtime
C++ code  + V8 engine = Node.exe
Ryan Dahl developed the Node js

Features of Node js->
1. Superfasy and Highly scalable
2. Based on javascript
3. Consistent and clean code base
4. Huge community support
5. Build on V8 engine, that compiles code directly to native machine code , resulting in the faster execution
6. Single threaded-> even it is, but it allows us to handle multiple requests efficiently, by running concurrenltly without blocking them
7. Asynchronous
8. No buffering - process data in chunks and do not buffer the data, leading to faster data processing and reduced memory consumption


2.) Paypal adapted node js system from the Java system, So they transforned syste from java to ndoe js 
The system was build twice as faster in java and lesser 33% code and with fewer people as well as performed well in 2013
